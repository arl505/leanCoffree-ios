# Privacy Policy

I'm not a lawyer nor a business person. I'm a software developer who created an app and thought it would be cool to have my app publicly available on the app store.

Apple requires a url to a priviacy policy for me to ship my app, so I am writing this.

I am not a security expert, I **do not** guarantee the security of your data. But I also am not an asshole.

I will take care to follow best practices to ensure the security and privacy of lean coffee sessions. I will not willingly sell or share data to any third parties.
